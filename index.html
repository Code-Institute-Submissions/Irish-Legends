                                            <p>When the baby Deirdre was born her father, Feidhlim, asked the wise druids to look at the stars and
                                                tell him what the future held for her. The wise druids answered: "This baby will cause great trouble.
                                                She will grow up to be the most beautiful woman in Ulster, but she will cause the death of many of
                                                our men."</p>
                                            <p>When the Red Branch Knights of Ulster heard this they were very worried for their lives. They went
                                                to King Connor demanding that baby Deirdre be killed. The king thought for a while. "I have an
                                                answer," he said. "Deirdre will be brought up far away from here and when she is old enough I will
                                                marry her."</p>
                                            <p>Deirdre was taken away at once to a deep wood. The king chose a wise old woman, called
                                                Leabharcham, to care for her and teach her. As Deirdre grew older she became as beautiful as the
                                                druids had foretold. She had long golden hair and deep blue eyes. However, she was a very lonely
                                                girl.</p>
                                            <p>One day, Deirdre told Leabharcham about a dream she had every night. "I dream of a tall dark
                                                warrior. His hair is as black as the raven. His skin is as white as snow. He is fearless in battle."
                                                Leabharcham was worried as she knew the man Deirdre dreamt about. "He is Naoise, one of the
                                                Sons of Uisneach. You must never mention your dream again. You will be married to King Connor
                                                very soon," she said.</p>
                                            <p>Deirdre begged Leabhorcham to send for Naoise so she might meet the man of her dreams, At first
                                                Leabharcham refused but she hated to see Deirdre unhappy and she gave in. Deirdre and Naoise
                                                met and they fell in love at once.</p>
                                            <p>"We must go far away from Ulster now," said Deirdre. "I cannot marry Connor." Deirdre, Naoise and
                                                his brothers Ainle and Ardan set off. They travelled all around Ireland but no one would help them
                                                because they all feared the anger of King Connor. Finally they sailed to a small island off the coast of
                                                Scotland.</p>
                                            <p>There they lived for some time until one day a messenger arrived from the king. He reported that
                                                King Connor had forgiven them. Deirdre did not trust the message but the Sons of Uisneach believed
                                                it. Reluctantly, Deirdre set off with them to Ireland. On the way she pleaded with them to turn back
                                                but they would not listen.</p>
                                            <p>When they arrived they were sent to the house of the Red Branch Knights, not the king's castle. Now
                                                Deirdre was sure that a trap had been set for them.</p>
                                            <p>Deirdre was right. Soon the house was surrounded. The Sons of Uisneach fought bravely but they
                                                were outnumbered. They were seized and brought before Connor. "Who will kill these traitors for
                                                me?" asked the king. None of the Red Branch Knights would kill a fellow knight. Suddenly an
                                                unknown warrior from another kingdom stepped forward. "I will kill them," he shouted. With one
                                                blow he cut off the heads of the Sons of Uisneach. </p>
                                            <p>Deirdre screamed and fell dying to the ground beside the body of Naoise. So great was her sorrow
                                                that her heart had broken. Deirdre's father was so angry Connor that he left Ulster and with went to
                                                live in Connacht. Many other warriors went with him and joined the army of Queen Maeve. This
                                                army was later to fight bloody battles against the Red Branch Knights. So Deirdre did bring sorrow
                                                and trouble to Ulster just as the druids had foretold.</p>

                                                most famous leader. His enemies were jealous of him, so they killed him. Cumhall's wife was afraid 
                                                that her young son Fionn might also be killed.</p>
                                            <p>So she took him to two women warriors who lived on the slopes of the Sliabh Bloom Mountains. She 
                                                asked the women to teach the young boy all that a son of Cumhall should know, for she knew that 
                                                one day her son would become one of the Fianna."</p>
                                            <p>At that time, any youth wishing to join the Fianna had to pass very difficult tests. He had to 
                                                defend himself against the spears of nine men using only a shield; he had to jump over a pole as 
                                                high as his head; and he had to recite twelve books of poetry.</p>
                                            <p>When the women had taught Fionn all the fighting skills he would need, they sent him to Finnéigeas 
                                                 the poet to learn the twelve books of poetry.</p>
                                            <p>Finnéigeas lived on the banks of the river Boyne. He had spent many years living beside this river 
                                                and fishing in it. There was a fish in the Boyne known as the Salmon of Knowledge. The person who 
                                                caught and ate it would know everything there was to know in the world. Finnéigeas liked the young 
                                                fair-haired Fionn and agreed to become his teacher.</p>
                                             <p>One day as Fionn was learning poetry he heard a shout. He rushed to the river and there stood 
                                                Finnéigeas holding a large salmon. "Take the fish and cook it for me please, Fionn," he said. 
                                                "Remember you must not eat any of it.</p>
                                            <p>Fionn did as he was told. He cleaned the salmon, lit the fire and put the salmon over the fire to cook. 
                                                All was well until a blister rose on the side of the salmon. Without thinking, Fionn reached out and 
                                                broke the skin of the blister. In doing so he burnt his thumb and sucked it to stop the pain. He finished 
                                                cooking the fish as Finnéigeas returned.</p>
                                            <p>The old man looked at Fionn and saw in his eyes the knowledge he had spent so many years searching for. 
                                                "There is nothing for me to teach you now," he said sadly. “You must go to Tara and take your father's 
                                                place at the head of the Fianna. Always use your knowledge wisely."</p>
                                            <p>Fionn set off at once to join the Fianna. From then on, whenever he had a problem, all he had to do was to 
                                                put his thumb in his mouth and he had the answer at once.</p>

                                            <p>Fionn said goodbye to Finnéigeas and set off. The road to Tara was busy with 
                                                people arriving for the great festival of Samhain.</p>
                                            <p>Fionn arrived in time for the feast but there was no seat for him in the banqueting hall. "Who are you?" 
                                                the High King asked. "I don't recognise you. Tell me your name. "I am Fionn, the son of Cumhall," said 
                                                the young man. There was silence in the great hall. All eyes were on Goll Mac Morna, the man who had killed 
                                                Fionn's father, Cumhall. The king spoke. "You are the son of a friend and you are welcome to my feast.' 
                                                He put Fionn next to his own He son and the feast began.</p>
                                            <p>During the feast the High King spoke. "For the past nine years Tara has been visited on the festival of Samhain 
                                                 by an evil spirit. This spirit appears in the form of a fire-breathing dragon which causes great damage.</p>
                                            <p>My magicians are powerless. Many warriors have tried to kill it but all have failed. Is there anyone among you 
                                                who will save Tara?" the High King asked. No one spoke. Fionn stood up. "What reward will be given to the person who 
                                                is successful?" he asked. "I will grant you whatever you want," replied the king. "In that case I will defend Tara 
                                                from the evil spirit," said Fionn.</p>
                                             <p>Fionn walked to the outer walls of the city. The sky was dark and there was no sound to be heard. The people were 
                                                gathered safely inside the walls. Fionn heard footsteps.</p>
                                            <p>"Who goes there?" he called. "I am a friend," came the reply. "I was a friend of your father's and I have come to repay 
                                                a favour your father did for me. As you know, when the dragon approaches he plays sweet music. Anyone who hears this music 
                                                falls asleep at once. Take this magic spear and as soon as the music begins press it against your forehead and the music 
                                                will have no power over you. I must hurry away now. Fionn was left alone.</p>
                                            <p>From the darkness came a low, sweet sound. It was the magic music of the Fairyworld. Immediately Fionn put the spear to his 
                                                forehead and although the people of Tara fell into a deep sleep Fionn remained awake. The dragon breathed a long blue flame. 
                                                Fionn aimed and fired the spear. The dragon fell dead on the spot. Fionn cut off its head.</p>
                                            <p>"What is your wish?" the High King asked. "I ask to be leader of the Fianna as my father was," replied the my proud hero. The 
                                                High King agreed. "You have a choice to make" the High King said to Goll Mac Morna. "You can accept Fionn as your leader or 
                                                you must leave Ireland."</p>
                                            <p>Goll thought for a while and then spoke to Fionn. "Here is my hand. I will gladly serve you. Once Goll Mac Morna had submitted 
                                                the other warriors of the Fianna followed. So Fionn became their leader, as his father before him had been.</p>

                                            <p>Once upon a time there lived a king called Lir who had four children: a daughter named Fionnuala 
                                                and three sons called Aodh, Fiachra and Con. Their mother, the queen was dead, and the children were 
                                                sad because they missed her terribly. They missed the stories she used to tell them, the games she 
                                                used to play, the songs she sang at bedtime as she hugged them to sleep.</p>
                                            <p>The king saw that his children were sad and needed a mother, so he decided to marry again. His new 
                                                bride was called Aoife. She was beautiful, but she was not the kind-hearted person the king thought she was. 
                                                Aoife grew jealous of the four children because their father loved them so much. She wanted the king all to 
                                                herself, so she planned to get rid of the children. She asked a druid to help her, and together they 
                                                thought up a terrible spell.</p>
                                            <p>In the castle grounds there was a lovely lake which the children spent most of their time playing beside. 
                                                One day Aoife went with the children to the lakeside. As they played in the water, she suddenly pulled out 
                                                a magic wand and waved it over them. There was a flash of light, and the children vanished. In their place 
                                                were four beautiful white swans.</p> 
                                            <p>One of the swans opened its beak and spoke with Fionnuala's voice: "Oh, what have you done to us?" she asked, 
                                                in a frightened voice.</p>
                                            <p>"I have put a spell on you," replied Aoife. "Now everything you have will be mine. You will be swans for 
                                                nine hundred, years. You will spend three hundred years on this lake, three hundred years on the Sea of Moyle 
                                                and three hundred years on the Isle of Glora. Only the sound of a church bell can break the spell."</p>
                                            <p>When the children did not come home that evening, the king went to look for them by the lake. As he came near, 
                                                four swans swam up to him. He was amazed when they began to call out. "Father, father," they cried, "we are your 
                                                children. Aoife has placed a terrible magic spell on us"</p>
                                            <p>The king ran back to the castle and pleaded with Aoife to change the swans back into children, but she refused. 
                                                Now he saw how selfish she was and banished her from the kingdom. Lir promised a reward to anyone who could break the 
                                                spell, but nobody knew how.</p>
                                            <p>Lir spent the rest of his life beside the lake, talking to his children, until he grew old and died. The swans 
                                                were heartbroken. They no longer talked or sang, and nobody came to see them.</p>
                                            <p>Three hundred years passed and it was time for the swans to move to the cold and stormy Sea of Moyle between Ireland 
                                                and Scotland. The poor swans were tossed about by the wild waves and dashed against sharp rocks. It was harsh life with 
                                                 little food and the years passed slowly.</p>
                                            <p>When the time came for them to fly to the Isle of Glora, the swans were old and tired. Although it was warmer on 
                                                 the island and there was lots of food, they were still very lonely. Then one day they heard the sound they had waited nine 
                                                 hundred years for. It was the sound of a church bell.</p>
                                            <p>The bell was ringing in the tower of a little church. An old man, called Caomhóg, stood outside. He was amazed to hear 
                                                swans talking and listened to their sad story in astonishment. Then he went inside his church and brought out some holy water 
                                                which he sprinkled on the swans while he prayed. As soon as the water touched them, the swans miraculously began to change 
                                                into an old, old woman and three old, old men.</p>
                                            <p>Lir's children were frightened. Caomhóg told them about God and his love for all people. They no longer felt scared. Fionnuala 
                                                put her arms around her brothers and all four old people fell to the ground, dead. Caomhóg buried them in one grave. That night he 
                                                dreamed he saw four swans flying up through the clouds and he knew that the children of Lir were at last on their way to Heaven to
                                                be with their mother and their father again.</p>

                                            <p>Fionn had a sister called Tuiren, who was so kind that everyone loved her. Everyone, that is, 
                                                except a witch called Ukdelv, who was jealous of Tuiren's kindness and loveliness and long fair 
                                                hair. So, one day, Ukdelv went to Tuiren's palace, and, waving her magic hazel wand, she turned 
                                                the princess into an Irish wolfhound. But because Tuiren had been fair-haired and beautiful, the 
                                                hound was beautiful too, and its coat was as white as snow. Ukdelv took Tuiren by the scruff of 
                                                her neck and dragged her to the house of a very grumpy man called Fergus.</p>
                                            <p>Fergus really hated dogs. When he saw Ukdelv and the big white wolfhound coming towards his house, 
                                                he ran outside and barred the door. "That dog can't come in here,' he said to Ukdelv. "She's smelly and 
                                                dirty and she'll drop hairs everywhere. Tuiren looked at him sadly and tried to lick his hand. He pushed 
                                                her away. "Get off me, you big hairy dribbler,' he said.</p>
                                            <p>"But Fionn wants you to take this dog in, said Ukdelv. She was sure that Tuiren would have a terrible life 
                                                in Fergus's care. Now, everyone did as Fionn asked, so, with a sigh, Fergus took the dog into his house. Ukdelv 
                                                smiled as she watched Tuiren follow him inside with her tail tucked between her legs and her ears down.</p>
                                            <p>But, although the witch had been able to change Tuiren's shape, she could not change her nature. Every time Tuiren 
                                                saw Fergus, she would try to lick him. She tripped him up with balls, begging to play. She pined when he wasn't there. 
                                                She was also the best hunting dog in the country, and the two of them spent many happy days together out in the woods 
                                                and the mountains and the marshes.</p>
                                            <p>So, as time went on, Fergus grew very fond of Tuiren. That dog is nearly human! he would tell his friends, not realising 
                                                that that was exactly what she was! He called her Princess, not realising that that was what she really was, too. He was 
                                                delighted when she had two little puppies, which he called Bran and Sceolan. They would roll around on the floor in front of 
                                                the fire, and Fergus would find himself laughing at them. He sometimes thought Tuiren looked as if she were laughing too.</p>
                                            <p>Fergus's life was much happier because of Tuiren. He was no longer grumpy. But Fionn missed his sister and was afraid that 
                                                something bad had happened to her. He used his magic thumb to discover that she was in Fergus's house. He travelled there 
                                                and as soon as he saw the big white dog, he knew that it was Tuiren. She ran to Fionn and put her paws on his shoulders, 
                                                licking him all over his face.</p>
                                            <p>Fergus explained how he had got the dog. They quickly realised that Ukdelv had put a spell on Tuiren. Together they went to 
                                                the witch's house and forced her to turn Tuiren back into a woman. Fergus was very sad to lose his faithful friend, but Fionn 
                                                got him a new puppy for company. Bran and Sceolan became Fionn's faithful hunting dogs and stayed with him always.</p>
                                            <p>As for Tuiren, she was very happy to be back with her family and friends in the palace. But because of her time as a dog, 
                                                she had changed. She sometimes got over-excited when someone mentioned going for a walk. At dinner, there were times when she 
                                                really, really wanted to pick up the bones from her plate and chew them by the fire. She missed running after rabbits. She 
                                                missed rolling on her back in the long grass. She missed being able to scratch behind her ear with her foot. She missed being 
                                                able to lick people she liked and bite people she didn't.</p>
                                            <p>And there were summer evenings when Fionn would come upon her sitting on the grass outside the palace, gazing into the sinking 
                                                sun and sniffing the wind, as if waiting for someone to call her home.</p>

                                            <p>One morning the Fianna were hunting deer on the shores of Loch Léin in Kerry. They saw a beautiful white horse 
                                                coming towards them. Riding on the horse was the most beautiful woman they had ever seen. She wore a long dress 
                                                as blue as the summer sky, studded with silver stars, and her long golden hair hung to her waist.</p>
                                            <p>"What is your name and what land have you come from?" asked Fionn, leader of the Fianna. "I am Niamh of the golden 
                                                hair. My father is king of Tír na n-Óg," she replied. "I have heard of a warrior called Oisín. I have heard of his 
                                                courage and of his poetry. I have come to find him and take him back with me to Tír na n-Óg.</p>
                                            <p>Oisín was the son of Fionn. He was a great hero and a poet. "Tell me," Oisín said, "what sort of a land is Tír na n-Óg?"</p>
                                            <p>"Tír na n-Óg is the land of youth," replied Niamh. "It is a happy place, with no pain or sorrow. Any wish you make comes true 
                                                and no one grows old there. If you come with me you will find out all this is true."</p>
                                            <p>Oisín mounted the white horse and said goodbye to his father and friends. He promised he would return soon. The horse galloped 
                                                off over the water, moving as swiftly as a shadow. The Fianna were sad to see their hero go, but Fionn reminded them of Oisín's 
                                                promise to return soon.</p>
                                            <p>The king and queen of Tír na n-Óg welcomed Oisín and held a great feast in his honour. It was indeed a wonderful land, just as Niamh 
                                                had said. He hunted and feasted and at night he told stories of Fionn and the Fianna and of their lives in Ireland. Oisín had never 
                                                felt as happy as he did with Niamh and before long they were married.</p>
                                            <p>Time passed quickly and although he was very happy, Oisín began to think of returning home for a visit. Niamh didn't want him to go, 
                                                but at last she said, "Take my white horse. It will carry you safely to Ireland and back. Whatever happens you must not get off the 
                                                horse and touch the soil of Ireland. If you do you will never return to me or to Tír na n-Óg."</p>
                                            <p>She did not tell him that although he thought he'd only been away a few years, he had really been there three hundred years.  Ireland 
                                                seemed a strange place to Oisín when he arrived back. There seemed to be no trace of his father or the rest of the Fianna. The people he 
                                                saw seemed small and weak to him. </p>
                                            <p>As he passed through Gleann na Smól he saw some men trying to move a large stone. "I will help you," said Oisín. The men were terrified of 
                                                this giant on a white horse. Stooping from his saddle, Oisín lifted the stone with one hand and hurled it. With that the saddle girth broke 
                                                and Oisín was flung to the ground.</p>
                                            <p>Immediately the white horse disappeared and the men saw before them an old, old man. They took him to a holy man who lived nearby.</p>
                                            <p>"Where is my father and the Fianna?" Oisín asked. When he was told that they were long dead he was heartbroken. He spoke of the many deeds 
                                                of Fionn and the Fianna and their adventures together. He spoke of his time in Tír na n-Óg and his beautiful wife that he would not see again. 
                                                Although he died soon after, the wonderful stories of Oisín have lived on.</p>
