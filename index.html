                                    <p>When the baby Deirdre was born her father, Feidhlim, asked the wise druids to look at the stars and
                                        tell him what the future held for her. The wise druids answered: "This baby will cause great trouble.
                                        She will grow up to be the most beautiful woman in Ulster, but she will cause the death of many of
                                        our men."</p>
                                    <p>When the Red Branch Knights of Ulster heard this they were very worried for their lives. They went
                                        to King Connor demanding that baby Deirdre be killed. The king thought for a while. "I have an
                                        answer," he said. "Deirdre will be brought up far away from here and when she is old enough I will
                                        marry her."</p>
                                    <p>Deirdre was taken away at once to a deep wood. The king chose a wise old woman, called
                                        Leabharcham, to care for her and teach her. As Deirdre grew older she became as beautiful as the
                                        druids had foretold. She had long golden hair and deep blue eyes. However, she was a very lonely
                                        girl.</p>
                                    <p>One day, Deirdre told Leabharcham about a dream she had every night. "I dream ofa tall dark
                                        warrior. His hair is as black as the raven. His skin is as white as snow. He is fearless in battle."
                                        Leabharcham was worried as she knew the man Deirdre dreamt about. "He is Naoise, one of the
                                        Sons of Uisneach. You must never mention your dream again. You will be married to King Connor
                                        very soon," she said.</p>
                                    <p>Deirdre begged Leabhorcham to send for Naoise so she might meet the mun of her dreams, At first
                                        Leabharcham refused but she hated to see Deirdre unhappy and she gave in. Deirdre and Nooise
                                        met and they fell in love at once.</p>
                                    <p>"We must go far away from Ulster now," said Deirdre. "I cannot marry Connor." Deirdre, Naoise and
                                        his brothers Ainle and Ardan set off. They travelled all around Ireland but no one would help them
                                        because they all feared the anger of King Connor. Finally they sailed to a small island off the coast of
                                        Scotland.</p>
                                    <p>There they lived for some time until one day a messenger arrived from the king. He reported that
                                        King Connor had forgiven them. Deirdre did not trust the message but the Sons of Uisneach believed
                                        it. Reluctantly, Deirdre set off with them to Ireland. On the way she pleaded with them to turn back
                                        but they would not listen.</p>
                                    <p>When they arrived they were sent to the house of the Red Branch Knights, not the king's castle. Now
                                        Deirdre was sure that a trap had been set for them.</p>
                                    <p>Deirdre was right. Soon the house was surrounded. The Sons of Uisneach fought bravely but they
                                        were outnumbered. They were seized and brought before Connor. "Who will kill these traitors for
                                        me?" asked the king. None of the Red Branch Knights would kill a fellow knight. Suddenly an
                                        unknown warrior from another kingdom stepped forward. "I will kill them," he shouted. With one
                                        blow he cut off the heads of the Sons of Uisneach. </p>
                                    <p>Deirdre screamed and fell dying to the ground beside the body of Naoise. So great was her sorrow
                                        that her heart had broken. Deirdre's father was so angry Connor that he left Ulster and with went to
                                        live in Connacht. Many other warriors went with him and joined the army of Queen Maeve. This
                                        army was later to fight bloody battles against the Red Branch Knights. So Deirdre did bring sorrow
                                        and trouble to Ulster just as the druids had foretold.</p>

                                    <p>There they lived for some time until one day a messenger arrived from the king. He reported that
                                        King Connor had forgiven them. Deirdre did not trust the message but the Sons of Uisneach believed
                                        it. Reluctantly, Deirdre set off with them to Ireland. On the way she pleaded with them to turn back
                                        but they would not listen.</p>
                                    <p>When they arrived they were sent to the house of the Red Branch Knights, not the king's castle. Now
                                        Deirdre was sure that a trap had been set for them.</p>
                                    <p>Deirdre was right. Soon the house was surrounded. The Sons of Uisneach fought bravely but they
                                        were outnumbered. They were seized and brought before Connor. "Who will kill these traitors for
                                        me?" asked the king. None of the Red Branch Knights would kill a fellow knight. Suddenly an
                                        unknown warrior from another kingdom stepped forward. "I will kill them," he shouted. With one
                                        blow he cut off the heads of the Sons of Uisneach. </p>
                                    <p>Deirdre screamed and fell dying to the ground beside the body of Naoise. So great was her sorrow
                                        that her heart had broken. Deirdre's father was so angry Connor that he left Ulster and with went to
                                        live in Connacht. Many other warriors went with him and joined the army of Queen Maeve. This
                                        army was later to fight bloody battles against the Red Branch Knights. So Deirdre did bring sorrow
                                        and trouble to Ulster just as the druids had foretold.</p>

                                    <p>Long ago in Ireland the king had special soldiers called the Fianna to guard him. Cumhall was their 
                                        most famous leader. His enemies were jealous of him, so they killed him. Cumhall's wife was afraid 
                                        that her young son Fionn might also be killed.</p>
                                    <p>So she took him to two women warriors who lived on the slopes of the Sliabh Bloom Mountains. She 
                                        asked the women to teach the young boy all that a son of Cumhall should know, for she knew that 
                                        one day her son would become one of the Fianna."</p>
                                    <p>At that time, any youth wishing to join the Fianna had to pass very difficult tests. He had to 
                                        defend himself against the spears of nine men using only a shield; he had to jump over a pole as 
                                        high as his head; and he had to recite twelve books of poetry.</p>
                                    <p>When the women had taught Fionn all the fighting skills he would need, they sent him to Finnéigeas 
                                        the poet to learn the twelve books of poetry.</p>
                                    <p>Finnéigeas lived on the banks of the river Boyne. He had spent many years living beside this river 
                                        and fishing in it. There was a fish in the Boyne known as the Salmon of Knowledge. The person who 
                                        caught and ate it would know everything there was to know in the world. Finnéigeas liked the young 
                                        fair-haired Fionn and agreed to become his teacher.</p>
                                    <p>One day as Fionn was learning poetry he heard a shout. He rushed to the river and there stood 
                                        Finnéigeas holding a large salmon. "Take the fish and cook it for me please, Fionn," he said. 
                                        "Remember you must not eat any of it.</p>
                                    <p>Fionn did as he was told. He cleaned the salmon, lit the fire and put the salmon over the fire to cook. 
                                        All was well until a blister rose on the side of the salmon. Without thinking, Fionn reached out and 
                                        broke the skin of the blister. In doing so he burnt his thumb and sucked it to stop the pain. He finished 
                                        cooking the fish as Finnéigeas returned.</p>
                                    <p>The old man looked at Fionn and saw in his eyes the knowledge he had spent so many years searching for. 
                                        "There is nothing for me to teach you now," he said sadly. “You must go to Tara and take your father's 
                                        place at the head of the Fianna. Always use your knowledge wisely."</p>
                                    <p>Fionn set off at once to join the Fianna. From then on, whenever he had a problem, all he had to do was to 
                                        put his thumb in his mouth and he had the answer at once.</p>

                                    <p>Long ago in Ireland the king had special soldiers called the Fianna to guard him. Cumhall was their 
                                        most famous leader. His enemies were jealous of him, so they killed him. Cumhall's wife was afraid 
                                        that her young son Fionn might also be killed.</p>
                                    <p>So she took him to two women warriors who lived on the slopes of the Sliabh Bloom Mountains. She 
                                        asked the women to teach the young boy all that a son of Cumhall should know, for she knew that 
                                        one day her son would become one of the Fianna."</p>
                                    <p>At that time, any youth wishing to join the Fianna had to pass very difficult tests. He had to 
                                        defend himself against the spears of nine men using only a shield; he had to jump over a pole as 
                                        high as his head; and he had to recite twelve books of poetry.</p>
                                    <p>When the women had taught Fionn all the fighting skills he would need, they sent him to Finnéigeas 
                                        the poet to learn the twelve books of poetry.</p>
                                    <p>Finnéigeas lived on the banks of the river Boyne. He had spent many years living beside this river 
                                        and fishing in it. There was a fish in the Boyne known as the Salmon of Knowledge. The person who 
                                        caught and ate it would know everything there was to know in the world. Finnéigeas liked the young 
                                        fair-haired Fionn and agreed to become his teacher.</p>
                                    <p>One day as Fionn was learning poetry he heard a shout. He rushed to the river and there stood 
                                        Finnéigeas holding a large salmon. "Take the fish and cook it for me please, Fionn," he said. 
                                        "Remember you must not eat any of it.</p>
                                    <p>Fionn did as he was told. He cleaned the salmon, lit the fire and put the salmon over the fire to cook. 
                                        All was well until a blister rose on the side of the salmon. Without thinking, Fionn reached out and 
                                        broke the skin of the blister. In doing so he burnt his thumb and sucked it to stop the pain. He finished 
                                        cooking the fish as Finnéigeas returned.</p>
                                    <p>The old man looked at Fionn and saw in his eyes the knowledge he had spent so many years searching for. 
                                        "There is nothing for me to teach you now," he said sadly. “You must go to Tara and take your father's 
                                        place at the head of the Fianna. Always use your knowledge wisely."</p>
                                    <p>Fionn set off at once to join the Fianna. From then on, whenever he had a problem, all he had to do was to 
                                        put his thumb in his mouth and he had the answer at once.</p>
